# Tidyverse Assignment - DATA 607
#### Don Padmaperuma

## Objective

In this assignment, you'll practice collaborating around a code project with GitHub.  You could consider our collective work as building out a book of examples on how to use TidyVerse functions.

GitHub repository:  https://github.com/acatlin/FALL2019TIDYVERSE

FiveThirtyEight.com datasets.

Kaggle datasets. 

## Tasks

You have two tasks:

1. Create an Example.  Using one or more TidyVerse packages, and any dataset from fivethirtyeight.com or Kaggle, create a programming sample "vignette" that demonstrates how to use one or more of the capabilities of the selected TidyVerse package with your selected dataset. (25 points)  

2. Extend an Existing Example.  Using one of your classmate's examples (as created above), extend his or her example with additional annotated code. (15 points)
You should clone the provided repository.  Once you have code to submit, you should make a pull request on the shared repository.  Minimally, you should be submitted .Rmd files; ideally, you should also submit an .md file and update the README.md file with your example.

## Dataset  

For this assignment I am using Women World Cup 2019 Prediction data set that I retrieved from [Fivethirtyeight](https://data.fivethirtyeight.com/) site to create a programming sample "vignette" that demonstrate how to use few of the main capabilities of the selected tidyverse package. 

## Tidyverse functions

slice(), filter(), summerise(), count() functions from dplyr. 

select(), gather(), unite() functions from tidyr
